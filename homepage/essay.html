    Gastronomic Capital

        On Saturdays at noon, I immerse myself in the Chinese gastronomy of dim sum, stir-fried rice cakes, bok choy, and hot Pu-erh tea, at a Shanghai restaurant down on Mott street. Walking down Mott street there will usually be an elderly Chinese man playing an erhu, with its traditional melodies propagating all the way down to Centre street. I’ve been a regular at 456 New Shanghai since it moved from Chatham square, being a go-to spot with family or friends. Upon arrival at the doors, I am greeted by vibrant red paper lanterns that sway in the wind with their dancing gold tassels. When entering the restaurant, a distinct aroma of delicacies tantalize my taste buds. As I make my way downstairs, I can hear the bustling kitchen directly next to the dodgy bathrooms; the impatient clanking of bowls and knives resonates within the walls, filling the space with chaotic life. Getting closer to the kitchen, the whiffs of Sichuan pepper, soy sauce, and garlic, the aroma of delicacies become more potent. During this sensory experience, I am reminded of just how much this city is truly a vibrant cultural crossroads, where I often get to teach curious tourists from a small town in Utah the fine art of eating soup dumplings without scalding their tongues in the process.
        My mother is from Hong Kong, so I have spent much of my life in Chinatown with my Po-Po (grandma), speaking Cantonese, praying at Buddhist temples, and occasionally dabbling in a game of Mahjong with her neighbors. Yet, to them, I didn’t immediately appear Chinese, and they were often surprised to hear me speak Cantonese.
        On Wednesday evenings I head up to Lexington Avenue to enjoy Indian & Pakistani eats that claim a loyal taxi-driver following. Right before entering Haandi, there are bright yellow taxis parked parallel to the street. The cosmopolitan atmosphere is filled with diverse people and languages; Arabic, Urdu, and Hindi echo throughout the room, as the enticing scent of keema, kebab, and spices fills my senses. Right downstairs, there is also a designated spot for praying. This space gives me a sense of comfort, since I know there is a place where people can practice their religion and culture. It reminds me of when my grandfather passed and many gathered to participate in prayer for him. I felt both grief and mourning— but also a strange, awkward detachment.
        In contrast, my father hails from Pakistan, and while I search for the unheard of nut-free gulab jamuns, I find myself listening to him chat in Urdu with the staff— a language I can hardly pronounce correctly.  When my paternal grandfather passed, and we gathered to honor him, I couldn’t understand the prayers spoken in his memory. I listened to the poetic verses of the Quran blend elegiacally with the soft murmurs of others beside me, in words I didn’t understand. Staring at my hands clasped in prayer I felt awkward, as if I didn’t quite belong there, and even feelings of guilt began to arise.
        I feel a deep connection through living vicariously in my parents’ immigration journey. Embracing the city’s culinary diversity reflects its rich melting pot. Yet, this connection is sometimes undermined by reminders of what I do not know, of my lack of familiarity I have with the motherlands of my family. The absurdity of it all: This space of heritage is infinite— yet I feel limited within— almost foreign to my own identity.
        While I navigate this paradox, I find comfort in sharing the art of enjoying a traditional Chinese dish with non-native New Yorkers, offering them a window into a new culture. I get to be a teacher of this culture in a place where I’m still learning. Enjoying these flavorful delicacies goes beyond seasoned chicken broth or the masala tingling on tongues; these culinary experiences are really about a hunger for knowledge being fed.  I take solace in being able to discern the traditional customs of how to enjoy a South Asian dish, such as using your right hand to wrap naan around keema or Nihari.  Despite any disconnect I feel, the unity I observe has shown me that fulfillment does not inherently come from belonging to a culture, it comes from the ability to appreciate it. Above all, I am reassured by the thought that I’ll wake again to the lively sounds of diversity and the connections that bring this dynamic metropolis to life.
